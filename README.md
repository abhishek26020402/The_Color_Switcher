# The_Color_Switcher
This project is a simple and interactive web app that changes the background color of a webpage at regular intervals. When the user clicks the "Start" button, the background color shifts every second, cycling through a random selection of vibrant hex colors. Clicking the "Stop" button halts the color changes, allowing the user to enjoy a steady background once again.
The app could be useful for learning purposes or just for fun, to add a bit of flair to a website.
This project offers a playful, engaging way to explore the randomness of color and provides a visually stimulating experience. It's a great demonstration of JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM and create interactive, real-time effects.
